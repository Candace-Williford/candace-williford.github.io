title: It's been too many days
---

Ok here's the deal. I've been frustrated with trying to figure out how to take my career to the next step. This blog is the beginning of me trying to answer that question. I've spent the last year mulling over this trying to figure out what the best thing is for me and what would make me happy. My main personal blocker to this is I got comfortable in my current situation but I'm not happy. I heard a quote by Steve Jobs the other day and it has been stuck in my head ever since.

> "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'no' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something." <br /><br /> -Steve Jobs
      
I'm tired of being comfortable. It's time to change. I'm determined to learn more about different web technologies and how in the world it all works together. I have only the slightest clue right now but I've started watching a .NET Core course on PluralSight and will be watching the .NET Core Rest API course next.

This blog is to help me learn these concepts. I'm a hands-on learner so things "stick" a lot better for me if I can actually DO them and then explain what I've learned.

It's my goal right now to commit to my GitHub about 2-3 times a week and this blog about once a week.

Let me know if you guys have any suggestions for resources. I'm all ears!
